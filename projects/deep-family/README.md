## 🌟 Vision & Mission

DeepFamily creates the decentralized family tree infrastructure, using zero-knowledge proofs and blockchain immutability to build a collaborative, verifiable, and perpetual family history recording system.

### 🎯 Core Principles
- 🔐 **Zero-Knowledge Privacy**: Private family tree construction with selective disclosure through NFT minting
- 🌍 **Globally Accessible**: Borderless family connections accessible from anywhere in the world
- 💎 **Immutable Heritage**: Permanent on-chain storage preserves data across generations
- 💰 **Smart Incentives**: DEEP token rewards for complete family data contributions
- 🤝 **Community Validation**: Endorsement-based governance ensures information quality

## 🎯 Core Features

### 🔐 Zero-Knowledge Privacy System
- **Private Member Addition**: Uses Groth16 proofs to add family tree members without revealing personal information
- **Salted Passphrase Unlinkability**: Poseidon(fullName, passphrase) prevents identity inference and family tree pollution
- **Dual Family Tree Models**: Public trees (shared passphrase) for collaboration, private trees (unique passphrase) for complete protection
- **Selective Disclosure**: Privacy protection during member addition, **full disclosure when minting NFTs**
- **Multi-Version Support**: Each person can have multiple verified versions with parent relationship tracking

### 🎨 NFT Value Creation
- **Family Tree NFTs**: Each person version can mint exactly one ERC721 token
- **Public Information**: **NFT minting reveals full name and biographical data to the community**
- **Story Sharding**: Detailed life stories stored in up to 100×1KB on-chain chunks with immutable sealing
- **Endorsement Requirement**: Must endorse a version before minting its NFT

### 💰 DEEP Token Economics
- **Smart Mining**: Rewards only granted when both parent relationships exist (complete family data)
- **Progressive Halving**: 10 halving cycles with expanding periods (1→10→100→1K→10K→100K→1M→10M→100M→Fixed 100M)
- **100 Billion Cap**: Fixed maximum supply with minimum reward threshold
- **Complete Family Incentives**: Encourages connected family trees over isolated entries

### 🤝 Community Governance
- **Endorsement Fees**: Pay current mining reward to endorse trusted versions
- **Fee Distribution**: Endorsement fees flow to NFT holders or original contributors
- **Version Competition**: Multiple versions per person, community selects best through endorsements
- **Quality Signaling**: Endorsement counts indicate version trustworthiness

### 📊 Advanced Data Management
- **Multi-Version System**: Each person supports multiple data versions with duplicate prevention
- **Paginated Queries**: Gas-optimized queries with 100-record limits
- **Family Tree Networks**: Complete relationship tracking through personHash/fatherHash/motherHash
- **Story Sealing**: Biographical data can be permanently locked for historical preservation

## 🏗️ Two-Layer Value System

### Layer 1: Private Hash Storage
- Add family tree members with zero-knowledge proofs without revealing personal information
- **Salted Passphrase System**: `Poseidon(fullName, passphrase)` prevents identity inference and pollution attacks
- Only cryptographic commitments stored on-chain (personHash, fatherHash, motherHash)
- **Dual Tree Models**: Public collaborative trees vs. private protected trees with unique passphrases
- Receive DEEP token rewards for complete family connections

### Layer 2: Public NFT Assets
- Community-endorsed versions can be minted as NFTs
- **NFT minting reveals full name and biographical information**
- Story sharding enables detailed on-chain biographies
- NFTs represent community-validated family tree data

### 🛠️ Technology Stack
- **Smart Contracts**: Solidity ^0.8.20, OpenZeppelin v5, Poseidon hashing
- **Zero-Knowledge**: Groth16 proofs, circom circuits, snarkjs integration
- **Frontend**: React 18, TypeScript, Vite, TailwindCSS, D3.js family tree visualization
- **Development**: Hardhat, Ethers v6, comprehensive testing suite

### Smart Contracts

**DeepFamily.sol** - Main Protocol
- Multi-version person data with ZK proof validation
- Community endorsement with automatic fee distribution
- NFT minting with on-chain biographical storage
- Story sharding system for detailed life narratives
- Mining rewards for complete family data

**DeepFamilyToken.sol** - DEEP Token
- ERC20 with progressive halving mining mechanism
- 100 billion supply cap, 10 halving cycles
- Authorized minting only by DeepFamily contract

**ZK Verifiers** - Privacy Protection
- PersonHashVerifier: Validates family relationships for private submissions
- NamePoseidonVerifier: Proves name ownership for NFT minting


## 🚀 Quick Start

### 📋 Prerequisites
- **Node.js** >= 18.0.0 (required by package.json engines)
- **npm** or **yarn** package manager
- **Git** version control

### 🔧 Environment Setup
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepfamilylabs/DeepFamily.git
   cd DeepFamily
   ```
2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   # Installs root + frontend dependencies
   ```

3. Configure environment
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Required for deployment and verification
   PRIVATE_KEY=0x... # Your deployer wallet private key
   ```

4. Compile smart contracts
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

5. Run complete development environment
   ```bash
   npm run dev:all
   # This starts: local node + contract deployment + demo data + frontend
   ```

### 🧪 Testing
```bash
# Run all contract tests
npm test

# Run with gas reporting
npm run test:gas

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test suites
npx hardhat test test/contract-person-version.test.js
npx hardhat test test/contract-endorse.test.js
npx hardhat test test/contract-mint-nft.test.js
```

## Usage

### Complete Development Workflow
#### One-Command Full Stack
```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run setup

# Compile smart contracts
npm run build

# Start complete development environment
npm run dev:all
# This starts: local node + contract deployment + demo data seeding + frontend
```

#### Manual Step-by-Step
```bash
# 1. Install dependencies
npm run setup

# 2. Compile contracts
npm run build

# 3. Start local Hardhat node
npm run dev:node

# 4. Deploy contracts
npm run dev:deploy

# 5. Seed demo data
npm run dev:seed

# 6. Configure frontend environment
npm run frontend:config

# This automatically configures for local development
# For manual configuration: copy frontend/.env.example to frontend/.env and update values

# 7. Start frontend development server
npm run frontend:dev
```
