# Smart Contract Deployment & Configuration Guide
This guide walks you through setting up your environment, deploying contracts, and configuring LayerZero (OApp wiring) for your project. Follow each step carefully for a seamless deployment experience.
---
## üõ†Ô∏è Step 1 ‚Äî Environment Setup
Create a `.env` file in your project root directory and add your private key:
```env
PRIVATE_KEY=your_private_key_here
```
> **Tip:**
> Keep your private key secure! Never share or commit it to version control.
---
## üì¶ Step 2 ‚Äî Install Dependencies
Install all necessary project dependencies by running:
```sh
npm install
```
---
## üöÄ Step 3 ‚Äî Deploy Contracts
Deploy your core bridge contracts to their respective networks using Hardhat:
```sh
npx hardhat lz:deploy
```
Result should look like
```
 npx hardhat lz:deploy

Deployed contract: DynamicONFTBridge, network: conflux, address: 0xdCe7e8289fe891209Cc6C850d76c7B5B8e401fFa
info: ‚úì Your contracts are now deployed
```

## üè≠ Step 4 ‚Äî Deploy NFT Collection Factory
Deploy the NFT collection factory contract (FactoryNftCollectionsMint.sol) to Conflux eSpace using the dedicated script:
```sh
npx hardhat run scripts/deployFactoryNftCollectionsMint.ts --network conflux
```
> **Note:**
> This deploys the NFTCollectionFactory and its implementation (BaseNFT) for creating and managing ERC721 collections with batch mint/burn support. The old MintNFT.sol has been removed in favor of this improved factory system.
---
## üîó Step 5 ‚Äî Configure LayerZero (OApp Wiring)
Wire your OApp using the LayerZero configuration:
```sh
npx hardhat lz:oapp:wire --oapp-config layerzero.config.ts
```
**‚ö†Ô∏è Note:**
- Transactions may fail during this process due to network or configuration issues.
- If a transaction fails, rerun the command until it succeeds (usually 4‚Äì5 attempts).
- This is a problem with layerzero not the code itself, currently getting feedback from L0 support to address the issue in the future.
- Upon success, you'll see:
```
info: ‚úì Your OApp is now configured
```
---
## üéâ Completion
**Congratulations!**
Your contracts are deployed and fully configured.
---
### Troubleshooting & Tips
- **Keep retrying:** Deployment and LayerZero configuration may require multiple attempts due to network congestion or gas issues.
- **Check logs:** Always review the terminal output for errors or confirmations.
- **Security:** Double-check your `.env` file and never expose secrets.
- **FactoryNftCollectionsMint.sol:** This contract provides an improved NFT factory system for testing and real use, with proper metadata support via BaseNFT clones. The old MintNFT.sol has been deprecated and removed.
