# DeepFamily - Decentralized Global Family Tree Protocol

## Overview
DeepFamily is a blockchain-based decentralized global digital family tree protocol that leverages blockchain technology, NFTs, ERC20 token economics, and community governance to create a collaborative, verifiable, perpetual, and globally shared family history recording system. The protocol implements a dual-layer architecture that balances privacy protection with value creation through hash-based storage and zero-knowledge proofs.

## Hackathon
Code Without Borders - SummerHackfest 2025 (August 18 â€“ September 22, 2025)

## Team
- HappCode (GitHub: @HappyCodeBase, Discord: blocknonce#0422)

## Problem Statement
Traditional family tree research faces several critical challenges:
- **Fragmented Data**: Family history information is scattered across private databases and personal records
- **Privacy Concerns**: Sharing personal family information requires trust in centralized platforms
- **Data Loss Risk**: Family histories can be lost when platforms shut down or data gets corrupted
- **Limited Accessibility**: Family tree services are expensive and geographically restricted
- **Lack of Incentives**: No economic motivation for people to contribute accurate family data

## Solution
DeepFamily solves these problems through:
- **Decentralized Storage**: Immutable blockchain storage ensures permanent family history preservation
- **Privacy-First Design**: Hash-based identity system with optional zero-knowledge proofs protects personal data
- **Economic Incentives**: DEEP token rewards encourage quality contributions and complete family trees
- **Community Validation**: Fee-based endorsement system builds trust through economic signaling
- **Global Accessibility**: Borderless protocol accessible to anyone with internet connection
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Users control information revelation from private hashes to public NFTs

## Setup Instructions

### Prerequisites
- Node.js v18.0.0+
- Git
- Conflux wallet (Fluent Wallet recommended) or MetaMask
- NPM or Yarn package manager

### Installation
1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/deepfamilylabs/DeepFamily.git
   cd DeepFamily
   ```
```
2. ZK Proving Key (.zkey) for Local Use
- Download `.zkey` (Groth16 proving key):
  https://github.com/deepfamilylabs/DeepFamily/releases/download/v1.0.0/person_hash_zk_final.zkey
- Place the file at: `frontend/public/zk/person_hash_zk_final.zkey`
  - The frontend loads artifacts from `frontend/public/zk/` and expects the exact filenames:
    - `person_hash_zk.wasm` (already included)
    - `person_hash_zk.vkey.json` (already included)
    - `person_hash_zk_final.zkey` (you need to download)

3. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm run setup
   # Installs root + frontend dependencies
   ```

4. Configure environment
   ```bash
   cp .env.example .env
   # Required for deployment and verification
   PRIVATE_KEY=0x... # Your deployer wallet private key
   ```

5. Compile smart contracts
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

6. Run complete development environment
   ```bash
   npm run dev:all
   # This starts: local node + contract deployment + demo data + frontend
   ```

### Testing
```bash
# Run all contract tests
npm test

# Run with gas reporting
npm run test:gas

# Generate coverage report
npm run test:coverage

# Run specific test suites
npx hardhat test test/personVersion.test.js
npx hardhat test test/endorse.test.js
npx hardhat test test/mintNft.test.js
```

## Usage

### Complete Development Workflow

```bash
# Install all dependencies
npm run setup

# Compile smart contracts
npm run build

# Start complete development environment
npm run dev:all
# This starts: local node + contract deployment + demo data seeding + frontend
```

#### Manual Step-by-Step

# 7. Start frontend development server
npm run frontend:dev

## Architecture

DeepFamily implements a sophisticated dual-layer blockchain architecture:

### Layer 1: Privacy Protection (Hash-Based Relationships)
- Hash-only storage of personal identities as keccak256 hashes
- Genealogical connections via personHash â†’ fatherHash + motherHash references
- Multi-version support with zero-knowledge proof integration
- Low-barrier participation without privacy risks

### Layer 2: Value Confirmation (NFT + Token Economics)
- Community-endorsed versions can mint unique ERC721 tokens
- Story sharding system for rich biographical content (100Ã—1KB chunks)
- DEEP token rewards for complete family relationship data
- Dynamic endorsement system with fee distribution

### Core Components (1,795 lines of code)
- **DeepFamily.sol** (1,384 lines): Core protocol with family tree, endorsements, NFTs
- **DeepFamilyToken.sol** (201 lines): DEEP ERC20 with progressive halving mining
- **PersonHashVerifier.sol** (210 lines): Groth16 zero-knowledge proof verifier
